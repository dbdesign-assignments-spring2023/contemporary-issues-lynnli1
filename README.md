# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss two articles about the current emphasis on data privacy in the era of big data and people's different insights on the future of digital privacy protection. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
 Shira Ovide, a writer who writes mainly in the tech section of the New York Times, published an article with the title [The Messy Progress on Data Privacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/technology/federal-data-privacy-law.html?searchResultPosition=6). The author briefly describes the chaotic data management of companies nowadays, for example, they obtain and analyze different users' data to personalize their advertisements and notifications, but there is not a limit to the protection and collection of users' personal information, which "creates conditions for abuse". The authors then discuss the proposals and controversies surrounding the creation of a federal privacy law, and the actual experience of GDPR. 

 In general, while the author believes that data management today is chaotic and messy, the future of data privacy management is looking up, as she states, "the defaults of America’s data-harvesting system are unraveling and more responsibility is shifting to data-collecting companies, not individuals, to preserve our rights."


## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Ovide's article on the issue,  Natasha Singer and Brian X. Chen's [In a Post-Roe World, the Future of Digital Privacy Looks Even Grimmer](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/technology/personaltech/abortion-privacy-roe-surveillance.html?searchResultPosition=34) express, as the title suggests, a negative view of the future of digital privacy.

The article focuses on the current situation of women seeking abortions in states where abortion is banned after Roe v. Wade was overturned, trying to evade all technology and data tracking, but to no avail. Courts can join with law enforcement agencies to take technological measures to obtain information about them such as internet usage records and license plate numbers. The authors cite a number of countermeasures such as proposed legislation and technology companies voluntarily deleting sensitive information from users.

But the authors conclude their article by expressing their view that there is no foolproof way to evade digital surveillance and protect one's data from being accessed and used by others, and even worse, "each piece of tech that’s used becomes a new vector for law enforcement to seek data."

## Conclusion
These two articles seem to me to provide a good picture of the two major  attitudes to the digital privacy debate in contemporary society,one positive and one negative. Regardless of the specifics of the debate, society is moving toward a greater focus on protecting people's privacy in the Internet age. And how technology companies can grow their business while protecting people's privacy is another issue that needs to be discussed.
